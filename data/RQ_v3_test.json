the social situation of the user. existing work on including social context uses some type of situation cue as an input to information processing techniques in order to assess the expected behavior of

characteristics of situations, which have been proposed in social science for ascribing meaning to situations, as the basis for social situation comprehension. using data from user studies, we evaluate this proposal from two perspectives. first, from a technical perspective, we show that psychological characteristics of situations can be used as input to predict the priority of social situations, and that psychological characteristics of situations can be predicted from the features of a social situation. second, we investigate the role of the comprehension step in human-machine meaning making. we show that psychological characteristics can be successfully used as a basis for explanations given to users about the decisions of an agenda management personal assistant agent.", "rq": ["rq 3: to what extent can social situation features and psychological characteristics of situations be used as a basis for explanations?"], "relatedWork": "elated work: the concept of sociality is broad, and so are its applications to artificial agents. the main directions involve agents being social with other artificial agents, and agents understanding human sociality. the agent technology research community has explored sociality from the point of view of artificial agents interacting with each other in multi-agent systems governed by structures such as norms, institutions and organizations (e.g., dignum , fornara et al. , maestro-prieto et al. ). the other research direction explores the sociality of agents in relation to humans. this is researched from the perspective of agents interacting socially with people (e.g., davison et al. , elgarf et al. , valstar et al. ), and agents modelling human sociality. an example of the latter is research on social signal processing, which focuses on using social cues such as body language to assess behavior . other approaches more closely related to ours employ some type of social situation information as input, and process that information to assess expected user or agent behavior. in our work we take inspiration from the way in which they conceptualize social situations. the key difference is that we explicitly reason about the meaning of the social situation for the user. dignum and dignum propose using social practices . social practices are seen as ways to act in context: once a practice is identified, people use that to determine what action to follow. for instance, the social practice 'going to work' can incorporate the usual means of transport that can be used, timing constraints, weather and traffic conditions, etc. a social practice is identified using information from physical context, social context, activities, etc. social context includes information about places and roles. each social practice contains a concrete plan which makes the connection between the social context input and the behavior that needs to be manifested in that situation. ajmeri et al. also highlight the importance of modelling social context in personal agents. social context includes information such as the place of the interaction or the social relationships between the people in the interaction (i.e., their role). in their approach, the agent includes the social information in the form of norms and sanctions that guide the agent's behavior. these norms and sanctions are formalized as rules in which the social context information serves as the antecedent and the behavior serves as the consequent: the agent exhibits a specific behavior only in presence of specific social context information. another approach on how to take into account the effects of social situations on user behavior is proposed in kola et al. . they model social situations through a set of social situation features seen from the point of view of the user. for instance, in a situation where a manager and an employee are meeting, the support agent of the employee would model this situation through features such as setting=work, role of other person=manager, hierarchy level=higher and so on. different from the previous approaches, in this work the relation between the social situation information and the expected behavior is learned rather than modelled explicitly. the authors show that it is possible to use these social situation features as input to a machine learning model to predict expected behavior such as the priority that people would assign to different social situations.", "conclusion": "<title>conclusions</title>"}

2. interviews and app store analysis play complementary roles in requirements definition; 3. app store analysis provides a relevant contribution in practice. at this stage, we looked into the elicitation and documentation process as a black box, and did not investigate the impact of the different means (mockups, prototypes) used for the analysis, and their relationship with the results. future work oriented to unpack this black-box will address this issue. furthermore, our work focused on quantitative analysis, and did not investigate the types of apps selected by the analysts, the strategies adopted to identify them, or the viewpoints of participants of advantages and disadvantages of the different elicitation techniques. these aspects will be studied in future work. finally, we also aim to observe the further evolution of the requirements into the actual products developed, to have a complete trace of their transformation. this study can serve as a baseline to support future automated software engineering methods oriented to manage requirements evolution."}

recommender systems can be useful for directing editor effort on wikipedia. for example, suggestbot -a task-routing system that provides personalized article recommendations based on predicted user interests-was shown to increase editor content output by four times compared to providing random recommendations. personalized recommendations in wulczyn et al. were shown to double editor engagement and substantially impact what content was edited. however, no research has focused on directing wikipedians' effort towards content that is higher priority for the encyclopedia. previous work has shown how the deployment of algorithmic tools that are not sensitive to stakeholder values can cause unintended harms. halfaker et al. , for example, describe how automating the reversion of bad wikipedia edits had the unfortunate consequence of driving away newcomers. this side-effect resulted from the design of algorithms that were blind to stakeholder values-in this case, wikipedia's \"please do not bite the newcomers\" policy -despite meeting objective standards of performance such as accuracy. the multi-stakeholder recommendation framework identifies three important stakeholders-the consumer, the provider, and the system . in this paper, we focus on the system as stakeholderi.e., we seek to understand english wikipedia's values with regards to recommender systems for directing editor effort. in doing so, we extend zhu et al.'s value-sensitive algorithm design (vsad) , which forwards the practice of incorporating stakeholder feedback early on in the design of algorithmic tools \"with the goal of increasing stakeholder acceptance and engagement, reducing potential biases in design choices, and preventing compromise of important stakeholders' values.\" we view our qualitative inquiry as an implementation of vsad's first step-understand stakeholders-with a particular focus on the encyclopedia itself as stakeholder. by adopting this framework, we hope to increase the likelihood that recommender systems to direct editor effort are designed in such a way that would make them acceptable to english wikipedia's community while successfully forwarding the encyclopedia's goals. while we seek to understand the encyclopedia itself as stakeholder, it is obviously not possible for us to interrogate the encyclopedia in a literal sense. instead, we structure our inquiry by building on bryant et al.'s findings about expert wikipedia editors (emphasis ours): \"for experts, or \"wikipedians,\" the wikipedia as a whole becomes more important than any single article or set of articles. whereas initial edits tend to be focused on correcting individual articles, once users become wikipedians, their goals expand. although they continue to improve the quality of the content in individual articles, their motivation seems to become rooted in a concern for the quality of the wikipedia itself. they also become concerned with improving the community. in the move from novice to wikipedian, goals broaden to include growing the community itself and improving the overall quality and character of the site. \" because of their concern with the quality of the encyclopedia as a whole, expert wikipedia editors-\"wikipedians\"-are an excellent (though admittedly imperfect) source for understanding the values of wikipedia as an encyclopedia, independent of the individual editors' interests. this leads us to use vital articles (va)-a collaborative project mostly engaged in by expert wikipediansas a proxy for the encyclopedia's values with regards to article importance. the concept of article importance has been used in prior work on underproduction in wikipedia , and is relevant to consider in selecting articles towards which to direct editor effort. an informal review of wikipedia article importance studies on meta-wiki finds that, while attempts to operationalize the concept of article importance are numerous and varied, pagerank is by far the most commonly used importance algorithm, appearing in 14 of the 50+ papers reviewed. shuai et al. , for example, use pagerank to compute and compare the scholarly and wikipedia importance rankings of papers, authors, and topics in computer science. lages et al. compare wikipedia university rankings-also derived using pagerank-to a reputable human-curated university ranking. similar methods are used in to measure the importance of people across different wikipedia language editions, to investigate the importance of wikipedia articles over time, and to examine how wikipedia and historians differ in their rankings of important historical figures. warncke-wang et al. , by contrast, take an approach to importance that centers reader demand. by examining the alignment of content quality (i.e., supply) and readership (i.e., demand), they find significant misalignment on the platform that systematically affects specific topicse.g., articles on lgbt issues are too low quality (compared to reader interest), while articles on military history are too high quality (compared to reader interest). but despite concluding that wikipedia does not adequately meet reader demand in these ways, they also question whether perfect alignment between content quality and readership is desirable at all. in other words, should we consider articles more important purely by virtue of their being more popular? if english wikipedia as a platform has the goal of maximizing value for its readers, using reader demand-i.e., pageviews-as a measure of article importance might make sense. in the quantitative portion of this paper, we examine how using these two aforementioned proxies for importance-pagerank and pageviews-to direct editor effort would compare with using va. though it is less common in prior research on importance, we also examine each article's total edit count, because it could reasonably serve as the basis for a standard recommendation engine-i.e., one that looks at what others have edited in the past to determine what users are likely to want to edit in the future. more specifically, we analyze each prioritization scheme through the lens of the encyclopedia's values on gender and geographical balance and investigate how adopting them might affect the composition of quality content on english wikipedia. in the process, we keep in mind how demographics can potentially stand in the way of actualizing values. lieberman and lin , for example, show that wikipedia editors can somewhat reliably be tied to narrow geographic areas-usually their places of birth or residence-based solely on their editing histories. hecht and gergle similarly document the phenomenon of self-focus bias, where editors mostly contribute content that relates to themselves. we highlight places in our results where these phenomena seem to present themselves and explore their implications in the discussion section.", "conclusion": ""}

existing barriers encountered by dashboard users. then we discuss the mechanisms for adaptive dashboards reported in the literature, which do not necessarily correspond to the mentioned barriers. while information dashboards are ubiquitous nowadays, understanding and using dashboards has always been problematic. existing difficulties are sometimes attributed to a gap between the visual literacy developers expect and the actual one . this gap is widened in domains that are inherently complex such as city governance or with users with low visual and analytic literacy . difficulties in understanding data on dashboards can also be caused by poor information presentation . data representation using graphs can be described as dry leaving some users uninterested . when it comes to self-tracking data, presenting correlations without overwhelming users with data is a known challenge . for users who need to know which information is relevant for decision making, some authors demand explicit instructions to operate dashboards . another example of misalignment highlights the lack of correspondence between the data and users needs in learning analytics dashboards . data sharing, privacy and security have also been common issues in healthcare and education-related dashboards . both academic advisors and students have concerns about sharing student data voluntarily even if it is intended to support student mental health or academic achievement . handling fragmented or incomplete data sources is another frequently reported problem where siloed data (data fragmented across different information systems) is detrimental for decision making . in healthcare settings, clinicians are reluctant to act on dashboards if they do not have access to the source of the data and the meta-data, which indicates a lack of trust on dashboards . another challenge comes from the inefficiency of support for user-requested features such as adjustments to the granularity of data aggregation and the functionalities to enable comparison, customisation and annotation tasks . also, user training was described as a huge challenge especially for clinicians who are usually time-constrained . on the other hand, some works also investigate challenges in implementing dashboards including data quality and tools' cost. data quality problems in dashboards have negative consequences for data completeness, consistency and accuracy . other authors report that business intelligence tools used to create dashboards are complex and need constant it support . dashboard design has also been an area of interest with works leading to design goals , design proposals and design implications . design goals include adaptability, transparency, intelligence and glanceability , while design suggestions include using a data storytelling approach as a learning design . jones suggests comparing self-tracking data based on the user's needs or using feedback from other users. involving all stakeholders in the dashboard design and development process has also been explored in education and operational monitoring with encouraging results and positive impact . recent research recognised that the full potential of dashboards could only be realised if individual users' characteristics are factored into design , which is an explicit call to user-centred design of dashboards. some authors suggest this could be achieved by providing support for customisation to adapt dashboards to users' needs , where automatic adaptation to different users and displays is still an open research problem. this idea was supported in the context of increasing dashboard understanding through the use of adaptive functionalities . some model-driven approaches to automatic adaptation include adaptive learning analytics dashboards based on users' activities, preferences and objectives and a visualisation recommender system based on use context, user characteristics, domain and tasks . our approach goes beyond the identification of dashboard problems: we firstly explore developer awareness of the aforementioned user problems and elicit developers' views on usable adaptation techniques to lessen existing problems. subsequently, we look into the feasibility of tailoring dashboards as a way to inform future interventions. thus, our paper contributes to (1) understanding developers' awareness of users' problems with dashboards and contrasting them to known ones as reported in the literature, (2) isolating new user interaction problems, (3) identifying the reasons behind the challenges from a developer perspective and (4) assessing the feasibility of using automatic adaptations to address users' interaction problems. while we find developers to be aware of these issues, users still encounter problems. this suggests that developer awareness alone is not sufficient and further interventions are required in the development process of dashboards.",

they also identified that frustration, name calling, and impatience were the most common types of incivility. miller et al. investigated toxicity, which is defined as \"rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable language that is likely to make someone leave a discussion\" in 100 open source issue discussions (including 20 github issues locked as too heated). the authors found that entitlement, insults, and arrogance were the most common types of toxicity in issue discussions. because the nature of discussions is different, previous work found different causes of unhealthy interactions in code review and issue discussions. in code review discussions, incivility was found to be mainly caused by the violation of community conventions, inappropriate solutions proposed by the developers, and characteristics of the maintainers' feedback . however, in issue discussions, users have been found to write toxic comments when having problems using the software, holding different points of view about technical topics, or being in a disagreement about politics and ideology (e.g., oss philosophy) . these studies also identified patterns of reactions from oss communities to unhealthy interactions. in code reviews, maintainers often discontinue further conversation or escalate uncivil communication . in issue discussions, although maintainers and other members may try to engage in a constructive conversation after toxicity happens, the discussion might still escalate to more toxicity . however, these discussions seemed to be localized; only in a few cases, the author who posted toxic comments would open another toxic issue . additionally, when maintainers invoke the code of conduct , the author of the toxic comments usually did not comment anymore. these previous results indicate that locking issues might be effective to stop toxicity. our study is built upon these recent works to focus on understanding (i) how github locked issues are used in practice and (ii) to what extent github issues locked as too heated are indeed uncivil. researchers have also worked on building classifiers to detect unhealthy interactions. recently, cheriyan et al. have proposed a machine learning-based method to detect and classify offensive comments into swearing and profanity. the classifier is trained with a dataset including conversations in github issues, gitter, slack, and stack overflow. raman et al. created a classifier to automatically detect toxicity on github. the authors manually validated github issues locked as too heated to train the classifier;

observe the increased prominence of anger words as predictive attributes of minority stress during the pandemic. to explain the differential impact on their emotions, we also contrast the linguistic difference in tweets between lgbtq population and general population during the pandemic by adopting a propensity score-based matching approach. our findings reveal that during the pandemic, lgbtq

$evroxwhdgglwlrqdolqfuhdvh (b) implications: past research work on lgbtq communities, have acknowledged the difficulty of accessing health related data (mcdermott, roen, and piela 2013). most of existing lgbtq health related research is limited to diagnostic reports and psychological questionnaires. we believe that the methodologies and results from our study can provide policy-makers with important health and well-being information to support evidence-based decisions for better understanding the development of mental health and minority stress among the lgbtq population. the need for such targeted approaches is more pertinent than ever in times of a global pandemic, as our findings also illustrate the disproportionate impact on the emotional and cognitive states of lgbtq population compared to the general population. we find that, on average, the lgbtq population has a greater increase in the usage of cognitive words and uses positive words less often during the covid-19 pandemic as compared to a group of the general population with comparable pre-pandemic behavior traits. prior studies have shown that the mental health of individuals within the lgbtq community is adversely affected due to the discrimination and bias they face. these pre-existing mental health conditions could make them even more vulnerable to the adverse outcomes of the pandemic, leading to threatening situations. we demonstrate the opportunities that machine learning techniques and social media data can offer to public health professionals. our methods can be used to build tools allowing the social media platforms to measure the relative increase of the minority stress among lgbtq individuals during public crises. this aligns with the american counseling association's code of ethics (association and others 2014), which suggests that counselors need to gain knowledge, sensitivity and skill to work with diverse backgrounds. our findings can provide counselors with the sensitivity and awareness about the discrimination and stigmatization that lgbtq individuals face to build client-centered practices. we believe that our research can complement the tools to further develop the minority stress theory. broadly, several studies have discussed the increase in fear, anger, and trauma during the covid-19 pandemic. aligned with these broader findings, our work demonstrates an increased association of anger with minority stress in lgbtq groups. our results can be used to build tools that reveal the feelings and emotions behind the language of lgbtq people. understanding the social media communication from the lgbtq population can offer a new lens onto the minority stress at the population level, which can be utilized to verify the existing research of the minority stress or identifying the underobserved variables of minority stressors. limitations: our work is grounded in meyer's theory of minority stress. although it is widely used for various empirical investigations on the health of the minority population, this framework has its own limitations. as acknowledged by meyer (2003), there is necessity to expand this framework and distinguish between different stigmatized statuses. future work could dig deeper into this issue by adding different psychological scales for different groups. another limitation of our study is selection biases. we choose twitter as our data source as it has many highly active us-based self-disclosed lgbtq users. this is likely to be influenced by self-selection bias as we can only collect data from those who expressed themselves on social media. this is especially true when considering that lgbtq people have long been exposed to stigmatization and prejudice. a further note is that we only use features inside the tweets to measure the minority stress. other features, such as frequency of posting and author metadata, could be incorporated to analyze the minority stress comprehensively. another research direction is to explore posts of minority stress across different social media platforms to build accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date feature sets and gain a better and more thorough understanding of this topic. lastly, our analysis does not differentiate results across subcategories of the minority stress due to the difficulty of extracting the context from a single tweet. future works can analyze the minority stress from the conversation level on twitter to better understand the minority stress."}

by investigating rq1, we hope to identify users who are more likely to get influenced by disinformation, which can be treated as a representative user group to characterize personality traits. by answering rq2, we expect to provide guidance on assessing whether different personality traits are affected differently with respect to the same attack message. by analyzing rq3, we hope to study the effects of disinformation over a period of two weeks on different personality traits. personality traits. personality traits are a key distinct feature that defines behavior, emotions, and interactions of an individual and is related to preference and interests. the big five factor model (also known with acronym \"ocean\") has been utilized in persuasive technologies and in information system research. the description of each personality trait can be found in table 1. it has been widely used to study the relationship between persuasive techniques and a promoting healthy lifestyle decision such as sustainable transportation , health promoting application , and health promoting games . personality traits have also been used to study the ability to discern news. in , wolverton and stevens reported that extraversion and openness personality traits were negatively corelated to fake news. however, their results should be interpreted cautiously because their analysis was based on a dichotomized response to single personality factor items and fake news identification was measured with users selecting which of the nine headlines, they believed were fake. most discernment of fake news studies are based on rating the accuracy of the headline on a scale to measure belief in a more sensitive manner than dichotomous judgements . however, to come to conclusion that the ability to judge a news article just by reading relates to susceptibility to disinformation seems a bit far-fetched. as stated in , individuals react to fake news based on the relevance of the issue. and it is possible that the news articles used in might not be of relevance to participants, and the ability to discern news might just be based on chance. hence, the results from should be cautiously interpreted. thus, we propose to evaluate explicit personality factors given by the ocean model and the change in opinion and opinion certainty based on an attack message.", "conclusion": "<title>conclusion</title> it is clear through our literature survey that disinformation is a highly complex area that has no direct solutions. the study mentioned above would help elucidate the relationship between personality traits, change in opinion, and change in opinion certainty due to disinformation on social media. we hypotheses to see that certain personality traits may be highly correlated to change in opinion, resulting in higher susceptibility to disinformation. using these results from this study as groundwork, we hypothesis to study and develop personalized narrative-based intervention techniques for different individuals on social media. it would lay the foundation for future research in field of countering susceptibility to disinformation and adaptive personalized inoculation techniques."}

what brings you joy? what do you appreciate in your life?' the process of conducting these interviews and asking basic questions about life and mortality produced demonstrable improvements in quality of life for patients. the only study so far to incorporate virtual reality into life review therapy was conducted by dang et al. which developed a virtual avatar to lead a life review therapy session with palliative care patients, which bears similarity to research conducted by tominari et al. which developed a virtual reminiscence therapy for dementia sufferers using 360 videos presented on touchscreen pads. in contrast to these examples, our research instead focuses on the creation of a platform for collaborative exchange between the patient, family and friends and the therapist to generate a virtual space of collective memory analogous to the legacy outcomes which result from traditional life review and reminiscence therapy interventions. vr/ar telepresence applications can also make an important contribution to palliative care by using haptic technologies to facilitate co-presence and enable affective communication by providing the opportunity for patients to touch their loved ones. even relatively simple tactile actuators can be used to convey a wealth of socio-emotional information and elicit many positive emotions similar to those of natural touch . for example, virtual touch has been shown to reduce anxiety triggered by watching a sad video and increase shared conversation while watching a comedy clip with other users . in addition to affective modulation, receiving virbrotactile signals from other users has been shown to promote co-presence and interpersonal connectedness and elicit helpful behavior and generosity in social decision-making paradigms .", "conclusion": "<title>conclusion</title> palliative patients suffer from a number of unmet needs, such as the inability to communicate with the outside world, the inability to remain at home during the last days of life, and the inability to travel with loved ones. based on an interview with a clinical psychologist in hong kong who uses vr in palliative care and a literature review of the current state of virtual reality therapies for palliative care we propose that vr and ar offer easily-accessible alternative therapies to meet the needs of patients which have yet to be addressed by traditional treatment approaches. we propose three systems to improve the interventions currently in use alongside detailed methodologies for conducting a pilot and field study using these systems on healthy and palliative care patients in hong kong."}

(2003) in the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut). they aspire to provide potential explanations for how anticipation about performance, social influences, and facilitating conditions are determinants of a system's acceptance and usage (venkatesh et al., 2003). in this context, several studies have already leveraged these frameworks for studying adoption factors. for example, van schaik et al. (2004) study the acceptance of gastroenterology referral cdss and find that performance expectancy is the most meaningful predictor of technology acceptance. other studies report reasons for low acceptance of evaluated cdss due to interferences with the workflow (curry and reed, 2011), presentation of already known information (terraz et al., 2005), or low confidence in generated evidence (sousa et al., 2015). nevertheless, knowledge regarding the adoption of human-ai collaboration has largely been unexplored so far as previous work a) has predominantly investigated non-ai-based cdss without considering them as equal collaboration partners and b) has focused its evaluation mainly on technical facets while neglecting user-centeredness concerning its adoption in clinical practice (lai et al., 2021). therefore, we aim to address this research gap in this work by deriving adoption factors from a user-centered point of view.", "conclusion": "<title>conclusion and future work</title> this study identifies factors influencing the adoption of human-ai collaboration in clinical decisionmaking. taking a user-centered perspective, we conducted a series of ten semi-structured interviews with domain experts. the analysis revealed six adoption factors for human-ai collaboration in clinical decision-making. professionals state the need for a complementary ai that communicates its insights transparently and adapts to the users to enable mutual learning and time-efficient work with a final human agency. subsequently, we contrasted them with existing literature on effective human-ai collaboration. while some factors fit into the prevailing concepts, our work has identified areas of tension in others that can provide an explanation for why adoption challenges may arise after the deployment of ai-based cdss in practice. despite providing valuable insights, this study is not without limitations. currently, our study is limited to ten interviews. however, its interviewees encompass senior and chief medical professionals from multiple hospitals and sectors. furthermore, due to its focus on the healthcare domain, future research is needed to evaluate the generalizability of the identified adoption factors in other high stake decisionmaking areas (e.g., the legal domain). some of our identified factors can be mapped to existing work and theories on adoption. for example, the complementarity of humans and ai can be interpreted as an expected performance improvement which is one of the key constructs in tam and utaut (im et al., 2011). however, other factors may be an extension as well. therefore, we plan to synthesize literature and our identified user-centered factors in future work. following that, we want to validate the extended set of adoption factors by conducting focus groups with medical professionals and ai experts. finally, we plan to conduct a quantitative evaluation with our refined and validated set of adoption factors. more specifically, we aim to analyze the influence of the identified factors on the effectiveness of human-ai collaboration through a user survey quantitatively. our findings can provide a starting point for deriving guidance for the successful design and deployment of ai-based cdss. building on the factors presented in this study, researchers and practitioners may derive design guidelines for future ai-based cdss to foster accepted and successful human-ai collaboration."}
