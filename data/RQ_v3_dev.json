"relatedWork": ": automating news podcasts. to the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work automating the creation of news podcasts. the system of yoshino and kawahara is the closest conceptually. they present a chat dialogue system using news sources as the subject matter. the system proposes topics to the listener, who can ask questions about the topic. a key conceptual difference with our work is that yoshino and kawahara 's system is designed for open-ended information navigation, requiring user input to advance the conversation, while we prepare a script for a podcast targeting a specific duration, allowing for a combination of passive listening or active question asking, with listener interruptions allowed at any point in the conversation. another important difference is the use in our work of multiple synthesized voices to simulate a conversation. some authors have written position papers and made forecasts about a future that includes automatically generated and personalized podcasts as is done in newspod. for instance, dubiel et al. suggest that news presented in a conversational audio form could increase engagement, allow for the presentation of multiple viewpoints, and allow listeners to ask follow-up questions to expand their knowledge on the subject. the bbc's r&d laboratory has published a series of vision papers on the future of audio broadcasting, including forecasts for a future in which audio news topics and lengths can be personalized . lochrie et al. manually built prototypes of news podcasts and performed an evaluation, which they used to propose seven recommendations for automating news podcasts. newspod follows four of these recommendations, namely: (1) the content should be adapted to the audio format with bite-size chunks of information (in newspod: questions and answers), (2) summarize key points, (3) leverage several specialized voices, (4) adapt the narrative style to the context. conversational interfaces for news recommendations. several systems have been proposed that retrieve news articles in response to a user's queries within the format of an interactive dialogue. bechberger et al. retrieve a news event based on a user query and the user's general interests, using text chat rather than audio. sahijwani et al. investigate different approaches for recommending news content as part of an alexa prize conversational agent. their system suggests a news article as part of the conversation, and if the user accepts the recommendation, a search engine is queried for news on an entity or a trending topic until the user rejects the recommendation. they find that reducing the formality of the recommendation and increasing the specificity leads to significantly higher acceptance rate from listeners. the multiple source effect posits that arguments coming from multiple distinguishable sources increases persuasion when compared to similar arguments made by a single source. experiments have also validated the multiple source effect for video as well as audio with synthetic speech . most related to our work, kang and gretzel find that when visitors of a national park listen to a podcast tour, including multiple voices in the podcast positively impacts the social presence and enjoyment of the visitor. in newspod, we capitalize on the multiple source effect by dividing the content amongst several roles, each synthesized by a distinct automated voice. conversational narration style. prior work has shown that modifying the narration style of multimedia content can have an impact on the listener's understanding, retention, and enjoyment. personalization by altering the point of view from neutral (3rdperson) to conversational (1st-and 2nd-person) has been shown to be effective in many learning domains in reducing cognitive load and improving listener understanding . in their study, kang and gretzel also find that when podcast tours follow a conversational format, it has a positive impact on the listener's enjoyment and social presence. by simulating a conversation in newspod with voices asking questions answered by others, we attempt to create an informal environment that is inviting to the listener.", "conclusion": "<title>conclusion</title> this paper introduced newspod, an interactive and automated news podcast. newspod organizes news content into a simulated conversation in which several automated voices ask and answer questions about a topic. the listener can at any point join the conversation by asking a question, which the system attempts to answer automatically. we evaluated the q&a narrative style in newspod through a usability study and found it led to participants finding the content more enjoyable and less monotonous, with 80% of the participants saying they would use the system again to stay informed on the news. a second usability study, centered on participant interactions, reveals that when appropriate breaks are included in the podcast, 85% of listeners ask questions and interact with the podcast. participant-prompted questions are found to be diverse, with a majority tripping up current neural networkbased question-answering models, reflecting current limitations in natural language processing. this alternative approach to news consumption may eventually serve to broaden the base of users who engage deeply with the news."}

the user experience when using these apps and visualisations is not evaluated yet. there are publications on personal data visualisation in the literature. still, no systematic literature review

been addressed well in the found papers, including health, sport, diet, driving habits, lifelogging, productivity, etc. the user types range from naive users to expert and developers users based on

data visualisation and adoption by users. however, the number of systematic literature reviews developed to cover this research field is limited. we found one slr paper covered the design criteria to develop data visualisation published in 2015 , and another two review papers developed in the area of evaluating software visualisation and learning analytic visualisation , . the recent slr that we found published in 2020 covered the type of health data for elderly people . out of the reviews mentioned above, there is only one review that is related to our topic . it reviewed 95 papers that were published between 2009 and 2019. the purpose of the review was to assess the proposed technology in terms of its easiness and allowance of entering health data and evaluating the appropriateness of the information presented with data visualisation. there are various data identified to track health data, including emotion, sleep, pain and time. smartphones are the top devices used by older people to visualise their health data. although this review claimed that information visualisation is straightforward in terms of understanding and interpretation of a displayed image, there are limited papers that describe the characteristics of good data visualisation. there were two main methods identified to evaluate mobile health technology, either quantitative or mixed, of both quantitative and qualitative . in terms of data visualisation evaluation, merino et al. conducted a literature review in which they reviewed 181 papers out of 387 papers published in softvis/vissoft conferences . they divided the evaluation methods into two groups traditional and non-traditional. the researchers found three ways: conducting interviews with participants or developers to gain hypotheses to be tested in the experiment, developing questionnaires to reaa ch a large number of participa,nts and recordisessionsions to evaluate user performance. there are three methods classified as non-traditional to evaluate software visualisation eye tracking to capture how participants see the elements in visualisation, log analysis to investigate how participants navigate visualisations, and emotion cards to help participants measurably report their feelings. although these methods are listed to be effective to evaluate software visualisation, yet three main barriers are limiting the evaluation of these tools: \u2022 the lack of ready to use an evaluation tool \u2022 the lack of benchmark to compare with the developed tool \u2022 the difficulty to find the right type of participants to share their knowledge in terms of visualisation techniques, two reviews agreed on classifying visualisation techniques into traditional and modern techniques , while traditional visualisation could be developed using a spreadsheet such as a bar chart, line chart, box chart, pie chart. the higher-level visualisation requires special tools to create charts like geo charts (google maps), time charts, running race charts, time logs, spiral displays, cluster maps and component planes. in terms of modern visualisation techniques, art and technology are combined to show energy consumption. for example, a floor plan can be presented, and red spots are presented in different areas of the floor to show power consumption . designing a visualisation interface is another challenge reviewed in 2015 by covering 22 studies to develop a list of visualisation design guidelines to show energy consumption . in their review, the researcher found that guidelines should be grouped into functional and non-functional criteria. the functional criteria involve the type of information displayed in the visualisation, techniques, and modes: the non-functional criteria are hardware and software integration, portability, and extensibility. based on the findings, there are five recommendations developed based on the design requirement. an example of these recommendations is if the visualisation should be portable and displayed on different platforms, the recommendation was to focus on the scalability, flexibility and accessibility . however, there are some missing challenges related to the type of users, visualisation techniques that can be used to show personal data, and mobile devices' ability to adopt this kind of visualisation.", "conclusion": "<title>conclusion</title> to summarise this slr, the papers that have been selected are based on the inclusion criteria provided and the search phrase adopted. then, the researcher summarised the found papers and found out the results for the research questions. many papers have addressed the first research questions related to the type of tracked personal data. however, the found papers have not sufficiently addressed the other research questions. therefore, to bridge this gap, more studies need to be done in the following areas: exploring the public's attitude toward visualising personal data and engaging with it. another research area that needs to be focused on is the capability of mobile devices to adopt various visualisation techniques and identify the basic and advanced tasks that users can do using data visualisation."}

\"making the complex clear\" . this paper follows the definition of morville and rosenfeld , referred to as the \"bible\" of ia, that defines ia as a set of four component systems (figure 2). the first is the organization system (org), analogous to the architectural arrangement of a building's \"rooms\", which has an organization scheme orgscheme and an organization structure orgstruct. the organization scheme is the way content is arranged or grouped (e.g., alphabetical or by task). an architect chooses the scheme according to the situations they want the information architecture to support, such as alphabetical (orgscheme-alpha) to support exact look-ups, or task-based (orgscheme-task) to facilitate high priority tasks. the organization structure defines the relationship between content groups (e.g., hierarchical (orgstruct-hierarchy)). second, the navigation system (nav), analogous to adding doors and windows to a building, enables users to traverse the information groupings and structure. some of the navigation system is embedded in the content (e.g., contextual links (nav-contextuallink)), while others are supplemental (e.g., site maps). third, the labeling system (label) adds signposts (also known as \"cues\" in information foraging literature ) to the \"doors\", such as the labels on contextual links (label-contextuallink), headers (label-header), cues/keywords (label-indexterm), etc. fourth, the search system, when provided, supplements the rest of the ia, to enable users to retrieve information using a particular term or phrase. the majority of ia research has focused on the design and evaluation of websites, but some has explored other domains. for example, ia has been used in the design of usable security tools , as the basis of a semantic web structuring tool , to investigate the accessibility, use and reuse of information across multiple devices , to evaluate different information visualization tools , and for mobile applications screen-reader navigation . one body of research has compared ia to other attributes of information sites. for example, aranyi et al.'s empirical evaluation of a news website showed that the content and its ia were the main problems . petri and power's study likewise found prominent ia problems when evaluating six government websites, with ia accounting for about 9% of user-reported bugs . other ia research has evaluated the usability of different subsets (organizational vs. labeling schemes) of ia. for example, gullikson et al. evaluated the ia of an academic website and reported that although participants were satisfied with the content of the site, they found its (ia) labeling to be confusing , and were especially dissatisfied with the ia's organization system. resnick and sanchez found that user-centric labels significantly improved user performance and satisfaction as compared to user-centric organization, which only improved performance if labels were of low quality . similarly, others have found that navigation success depends more on the quality of labels than the structure of a page . of particular interest is ia research on supporting diverse populations. lachner et al. used ia to promote cultural diversity and used hofstede et al. power distance cultural dimension to design and evaluate culturally-specific collaborative q&a websites . accessibility and ia has been studied by others. swierenga et al. showed that ia's organization and labeling system create barriers for visually impaired and low-vision individuals . a multitude of research has investigated ia auditory systems for designing and evaluating accessible websites for low-vision users. ghahari et al., for example, showed how topic-and list-based aural navigation

successful. gamification misuse is a phenomenon that occurs when users become too fixated on gamification and get distracted from learning. this undesirable phenomenon wastes users' precious time and negatively impacts their learning performance. however, there has been little research in the literature to understand gamification misuse and inform future gamification designs. therefore, this paper aims to fill this knowledge gap by conducting the first extensive qualitative research on gamification misuse in a popular learning app called duolingo. duolingo is currently the world's most downloaded learning app used to learn languages. this study consists of two phases: (i) a content analysis of data from duolingo forums (from the past nine years) and (ii) semi-structured interviews with 15 international duolingo users. our research contributes to the human-computer interaction (hci) and learning at scale (l@s) research communities in three ways: (1) elaborating the ramifications of gamification misuse on user learning, well-being, and ethics, (2) identifying the most common reasons for gamification misuse (e.g., competitiveness, overindulgence in playfulness, and herding),

practitioners deal with the problem of gamification misuse?"], "relatedWork": "nd background 2.1 gamification, motivation, and learning: one of the most important opportunities for the use of gamification lies in the field of educational technologies . in general, gamification implies using game design elements in non-game contexts , and it is typically implemented via the blap system put forward by nicholson, which encompasses using badges, levels/leaderboards, achievements, and points . the basic aim of these awards is to encourage individuals to perform specific activities and achieve particular accomplishments . a recent study conducted by the famous gamification group of tampere university shows that using gamification for educational purposes can improve students' performances (in the learning tasks) by up to 89.45% . in another study, researchers have shown that 67.7% of students prefer gamified learning better than the traditional (so-called passive learning ) courses . all of these findings point to a promising future for the growth of gamification in education . at its core, gamification aims at enhancing people's motivation to perform various tasks . in general, motivation can come from two sources, whether intrinsic or extrinsic . intrinsic motivation occurs when there is no compensation or reward for performing a particular action, and the action itself is perceived as interesting and enjoyable . in contrast, extrinsic motivation refers to a situation in which people perform activities to achieve a desired outcome other than the activity itself (e.g., to earn more revenue) . gamification is thus inherently related to the latter type of motivation . furthermore, previous research has shown that motivation is an essential component of education that ultimately affects how students interact with learning platforms or essentially learn . for example, intrinsically motivated learners have been shown to complete their studies with greater engagement (or commitment) than extrinsically motivated learners . according to deci, extrinsic motivation can increase or decrease intrinsic motivation, depending on the nature of the external reward . for example, positive feedback (as a gamification element ) has been shown to significantly boost individuals' intrinsic motivation, while other gamification incentives such as competition and performance-based rewards have been widely criticized because they can undermine learners' intrinsic motivation . furthermore, rewarding previously unrewarded tasks could sometimes change the intrinsic motivation of users into an extrinsic one, also called the over-justification effect . therefore, although gamified learning is being lauded for its ability to engage users and help them achieve suitable learning outcomes, the approach is not devoid of concerns. next, we review the literature to exemplify the most salient instances of gamification misuse and delineate the most important underlying theories.", "conclusion": "<title>conclusion</title> in this paper, we looked at the problem of gamification misuse in duolingo, the world's most popular learning application. we studied the misusing behavior from the users' perspective from three aspects: the negative effects they experienced (rq1), their reasons for this behavior (rq2), and finally, their suggestions for practitioners and designers (rq3). in rq1, we found that the misuse of gamification could negatively influence users' learning aptitude and capacity, well-being, and even threaten their ethics. in rq2, we observed several potential reasons for the misuse of gamification. we carefully coded the reasons into active and passive reasons based on the users' perceived role (agency) in the misuse. in rq3, we offered gamification designers and practitioners working on learning apps some suggestions to prevent or mitigate the misuse of gamification. all in all, we believe that this paper could serve as an important reference in the hci and l@s communities for understanding the problem of gamification misuse in learning apps."}

paradigm allows humans to directly impact the working of ai, and requires using algorithms that can incorporate human input to update the model, which can be technically challenging or infeasible in practice. another rich area to study human-ai collaboration is ai-assisted or \"machine/algorithm-in-the-loop\" decision-making . in this paradigm, ai performs an assistive role by providing a prediction or recommendation, while the human decision maker makes the final call and may choose to accept or reject the ai recommendation. several studies explored the questions of whether and how to achieve complementary performance, i.e., the collaborative decision outcome outperforming human or ai alone . the empirical results, however, are mixed at best, because there was either insufficient complementarity in human and ai's domain knowledge or a lack of ability for people to judge the reliability of ai recommendations. this approach tends to focus on high-stakes decisions and are not scalable in the number of decisions because humans are required to make each decision. another line of work explores intelligent systems and considers different tasks that ai can perform and the optimal level of automation versus human agency . for example, building on a classic model of levels of automation , mackeprang et al. proposed a design framework that decomposes the design space of an intelligent system into sub-tasks then allocates human, ai or both to perform each sub-task. the goal of our work is to have ai partially automate a large volume of decisions rather than assisting individual decisions. extending existing models of human agency and automation , we introduce proactive human agency, with which human can act and exercise control prior to model deployment, instead of reacting to model outputs. by conducting a controlled experiment, we explore whether this new human-ai collaboration paradigm can achieve complementary performance by outperforming ai and manual approaches. while some prior work also discussed delegation based on predicted outputs (e.g., predicted probability) , our work focuses on identifying trustworthy regions in the input space. furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first study with controlled experiments to examine the effect of conditional delegation.", "conclusion": ""}

rich body of information . many recent studies have focused on how oss community members interact in the issue discussion threads. for example, rath and m\u00e4der identified three patterns of issue discussions: (1) monolog, (2) feedback, and (3) collaboration. sanei et al. found that affective states expressed in oss issue discussions have a complex association with many issue characteristics. nurwidyantoro et al. identified that issue discussions do not only express system value themes, but they also are a rich source of human value themes such as dignity, inclusiveness, and privacy. researchers have also investigated negative social interactions, such as incivility and toxicity , that happened in itss and related software engineering artifacts. to help address the complexity of

itss, previous studies that focused on understanding general usage patterns of itss have established that visual contents play an important role. intuitively, the use of visual contents supports the discussion of usability and user interface issues . however, studies also revealed the importance of visual contents in discussions beyond usability issues. for example through a survey study, bettenburg et al. identified that although developers often need visual contents such as screenshots to understand the issue, bug reporters sometimes overlooked the importance of such contents. related, breu et al. found that information such as examples, program output, and screenshots are often missing in the bug reports and frequently requested by the developers. similarly, davies and roper identified that visual contents such as screenshots were often not included in the original bug report but provided as an attachment in a later comment. although screenshots provided useful information, the authors expressed concerns about utilizing such information due to the challenges involved in analyzing these visual contents . a more optimistic view is discussed by nayebi in a recent vision paper . the author argued that, with the trend of using visual contents in software development and the support of machine learning techniques, extracting useful information from these contents would become increasingly relevant. a few concrete attempts were made in this direction. for example, wang et al. proposed a technique that combines the screenshot image features with textual

these relationships typically involve power differentials within an organizational or social hierarchy. inspired by this tradition, we conduct interviews with a specific group-labor organizers in the computing technology industry-to shed light on the risks its members experience, and how digital technologies are involved in strategies to mitigate and address those risks. individuals involved in collective action at their workplaces face immense personal risks to their jobs, which affects their financial security, access to healthcare, and ability to support their loved ones. in addition, since labor organizing is a collective rather than individual project, notions of privacy that center individuals may be incompatible with the needs of organizers. this is unlike other at-risk populations where the primary resolution of privacy risks can be centered around better tools for individual privacy. through our current work, we address how labor organizers come up with practices around privacy-enhancing tools and how they negotiate which practices and tools to adopt as a collective (rq1).", "conclusion": "<title>conclusion</title> an energetic resurgence of the labor movement in the u.s. is currently underway. workers across industries, workplaces, and occupations are fighting for more control over their working conditions and the applications of their labor, and tech workers are no exception. while digital technologies have provided the infrastructure for much of the communication within these movements, particularly during the pandemic, they also function as sites of tension between privacy and openness, security and risk-taking, the individual and the collective. through a series of qualitative interviews with tech workers in the u.s. involved in collective action at their workplaces, we identify key themes in the challenges to organizers' privacy. first, organizers respond to a diverse set of risks and threat actors by adopting digital security practices as well as social, community-based mechanisms for protecting worker privacy. these latter techniques were particularly important in dealing with lateral worker conflict, and led to the prioritization of usability and familiarity above purely technical features when choosing platforms to support internal collaboration within the collective. second, participants framed privacy as a construct that operated at both the individual and collective level: although there were tensions between these types of privacy, privacy at one level was not possible without privacy at the other. we pair these theoretical observations with design recommendations that can create a safer environment for workers organizing in the computing technology industry. while, as academics, we believe it is important to understand how labor organizers in the computing technology industry interact with digital technologies to secure the privacy of themselves and their co-workers, we also emphasize that technology is only one component of a collective's larger strategy to win. whether the collective effort succeeds or fails is underdetermined when viewed solely through the lens of technology: instead, organizing is an ongoing, active process that is influenced by a host of exogenous factors. during the interview process, we were repeatedly awestruck at the resilience, tenacity, and agency that organizers demonstrated in the face of illegal retaliation, heated conflict, and unpredictable obstacles. in these stories, we find hope not only in hard-won successes like the recognition of unions, but also the efforts that fell short of their goals. resistance is always an exercise in which success is not guaranteed. that the role of technology is but one element in a larger story of human agency in the labor movement is, in our view, a cause for hope.

Evaluating and Enhancing Risk-Based Authentication on a Real-World Large-Scale Online Service", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15139v1[cs.CR]", "keywords": ["CCS Concepts: \u2022 Security and privacy \u2192 Authentication", "Access control", "Web application security", "Privacy protections", "Usability in security and privacy"], "abstract": "isk-based authentication (rba) aims to protect users against attacks involving stolen passwords. rba monitors features during login, and requests re-authentication when feature values widely differ from previously observed ones. it is recommended by various national security organizations, and users perceive it more usable and equally secure than equivalent two-factor authentication. despite that, rba is still only used by very few online services. reasons for this include a lack of validated open resources on rba properties, implementation, and configuration. this effectively hinders the rba research, development, and adoption progress. to close this gap, we provide the first long-term rba analysis on a real-world large-scale online service. we collected feature data of 3.3 million users and 31.3 million login attempts over more than one year. based on the data, we provide (i) studies on rba's real-world characteristics, and its configurations and enhancements to balance usability, security, and privacy, (ii) a machine learning based rba parameter optimization method to support administrators finding an optimal configuration for their own use case scenario, (iii) an evaluation of the round-trip time feature's potential to replace the ip address for enhanced user privacy, and (iv) a synthesized rba data set to reproduce this research and to foster future rba research. our results provide insights on selecting an optimized rba configuration so that users profit from rba after just a few logins. the open data set enables researchers to study, test, and improve rba for widespread deployment in the wild.", "rq": ["rq 3: how long do we need to store login history data to maintain good rba security and usability?", "rq 5: what are performance implications of rba on a large-scale online service and how can they be improved?"], "relatedWork": ": with our contributions, we extend the related work in various aspects, which we discuss below. freeman et al. tested their rba model in a case study using 300k legitimate logins collected during six months on the popular large-scale online service linkedin. however, they did not provide an analysis of rba characteristics in practice. also, for such a large-scale online service, the sample was rather small. to provide a more realistic estimate, we analyzed rba characteristics using 12.5m legitimate logins collected in more than one year. wiefling et al. tested freeman et al. 's model on a small online service with 9,555 legitimate logins collected over 1.8 years. their and our results confirmed that ip address, user agent string, and rtt are useful rba features. our work also extended the analysis, e.g., for different login frequencies. wiefling et al. proposed and tested privacy enhancements for rba. due to their small data set, they were not able to test their proposed login history minimization approach. we filled this research gap and tested this approach on a large-scale online service. alaca and van oorschot evaluated a list of features regarding their ability to identify users. regarding distinguishing information, they rated the ip address feature higher than the rtt. they noted, however, that the latter required further study. there were different rtt implementations for rba proposed in concurrent and independent work. rivera et al. proposed a client-originated version. wiefling et al. proposed a server-initiated solution which they considered harder to spoof for attackers. the studies in both works showed the rtt's potential to verify countries and users . our work furthermore showed rtt's potential to verify regions, and to replace the ip address as a feature. campobasso and allodi studied a criminal infrastructure that used malware-infected devices to bypass rba. the rtt feature can detect such attempts, as the infrastructure used socks5 proxies. doerfler et al. evaluated rba re-authentication challenges on a sample of 1.2m legitimate google users. they stated that their rba implementation was able to block 99.99% of automated account takeover attempts and 92% of phishing attacks. our study results with 3.3m legitimate users reflect their findings. besides rba, there are other related methods which aim to protect user accounts against automated attacks. captchas are a widely used measure to block bot traffic by presenting a challenge that, in contrast to bots, are solvable by humans with a lower error rate. some rba systems also present captchas in some occasions to increase friction only for bot-like traffic . solving captchas, however, is still error prone for humans , so achieving usable captchas can be considered a challenge. bots can also bypass them by proxying the captcha challenge to real humans or machine learning algorithms . these bypass methods are scalable in practice. rba, in contrast, depends on the specific user. thus, proxying can not scale when rba uses appropriate features, e.g., the rtt. another method is attribute-based authentication (attribute-based credentials, abc) . in this case, users authenticate to an online service by providing a verified attribute, e.g., their age to prove that they are over 18 years old. the verification is done by a trusted authority and the information presented to the online service can be done using pseudonyms. therefore, online services only receive the information that is required for their service, e.g., that the user is over 18 without getting personal details. abc can increase user privacy, but is independent from rba, as the latter does not require verified personal details. however, abc is thinkable as a re-authentication challenge in high risk environments where users expect increased security, e.g., online shopping or online banking 15 conclusion and suggestions online services are a popular attack target . stolen passwords used, for example, in credential stuffing attacks pose new security challenges to service developers, operators, and owners . as these attacks increased for years , rba becomes an important measure for online services to protect their users. nist, ncsc, and acsc recommend rba , some of them for more than three years. still, current literature does not provide any insights on implementing, configuring, and operating rba on these types of online services. these insights are important, though, to achieve rba's security gain while balancing usability and privacy. only a fraction of work exists that focuses on rba algorithms or studies, all of them on small online services. we studied rba characteristics on a large-scale online service to close this research gap. our results, based on our data set of a large online service, confirm previous results, based on a small online service, that rba rarely requests re-authentication in practice, even when blocking more than 99% of targeted attackers. as new results, our evaluation furthermore shows that rba can even detect a high number of very targeted account takeover attempts. the rba behavior also significantly depends on the users' login frequencies. for daily use websites, rba can achieve very high security with few re-authentication requests. for monthly use websites, the percentage of blocked attackers needs to be lowered down to around 2-3% to achieve a similar usability for targeted attackers. still, a high percentage of attackers would be blocked for all user types. therefore, we consider rba an effective measure to protect users from the majority of attacks involving stolen passwords. besides that, the rtt showed to be a promising rba feature to verify regions and to identify users while increasing user privacy. rba needs to be carefully evaluated for and adapted to each individual use case scenario. based on our findings, rba system designers should consider the following to find the best configuration for their environment: (i) the amount of minimizing the login history needs to be carefully adjusted to users' login frequencies. online services with a daily user base should keep at least six months of login history for a stable setup that blocks targeted attackers. when blocking naive attackers only, which represented 97% of all identified incidents at the online service, reducing to three months is possible. (ii) attack data should be used only with caution or not at all, as these can greatly decrease the usability and security properties. (iii) to achieve an optimal basic configuration in short time, administrators can use the introduced ml-based rba parameter optimization. for further adjustment, they can increase or reduce the resulting access thresholds to decrease or increase the security and average re-authentication count, respectively. (iv) non-optimized rba is potentially vulnerable to denial of service when multiple users log in at similar times. to mitigate this, and to considerably shorten the authentication time, the implementation of the rba algorithm needs to be carefully designed using efficient data structures such as hash tables. our results and the synthesized data set support online services to gain a widespread understanding of rba. in future work, we will use these insights to create an open source rba solution that significantly improves usability, security, and privacy compared to the only open solution currently available, i.e., openam . the data set will be used as testing data to evaluate our solution. a synthesized data set our synthesized data set can be downloaded at https://github.com/das-group/rba-dataset. as this paper introduces our open data set, we ask researchers to cite this paper whenever they publish own results obtained from adopting our data set. for broad compatibility, we provide the data as a csv file. table 6 shows the available features in the synthesized data set and the data types. we kept the feature values in readable notation to facilitate understanding. the values may need to be converted to more efficient data types to speed up risk score calculation. for instance, the ip address could be converted to its integer value. other string-based features could be hashed and converted to integer values as well. common synthetic data generation methods rely on learning the real values of a data set, which, however, does not provide a strong privacy guarantee . therefore, we used our own generation method that was tailored to the use in rba models used by the majority of online services in the wild . we created the synthetic data set as follows: as common rba models only rely on the number of occurrences of categorical data, we did not have to reuse any of the original feature values. we transformed all unique data set values to a random pseudonymous identifier and added randomness to the timely order, to keep the statistical relations between different feature values. then, we randomly assigned feature values from a location-to-asn-to-ip data set in backwards hierarchy (i.e., country \u2192 region \u2192 city \u2192 asn \u2192 ip address). if the original ip address was used in an attack, we made sure that the randomly assigned ip address is an attack ip address as well. we repeated the same procedure for the user agent strings. depending on the synthesized geolocation data and the login success status, we randomly drew the rtts for the corresponding entries, to ensure that the rtt results are realistic ones. finally, we generated the login timestamps with random noise following the distributions and the timely order (see figure 10 in section 11). we verified the synthesized data set by recalculating the study results from this paper. as our generation process does not reuse feature values from the original data set, the synthesized data set should not provide any personal identifiable information. nevertheless, we evaluated the privacy attributes of the synthesized data set using stadler et al. and other comparable frameworks. 7. rq4, study 1: achieved tprs for the ml-generated dynamic access thresholds in practice. we trained the ml models on 24 consecutive slices of the data set. the hybrid method achieved higher tprs than the linear and poly models.", "conclusion": ""}
